### My Exit

today I wrote my first assembly program. even though I wrote programs in assembly previously. But those were without understanding what the code was doing. I just coded it up. But Today I understood each section. I learned about **Directives** which is an instruction to the assembler. As you can see in the `myexit.s` The **entry point** to the program is `_start` this is where the instructions are run by CPU. So to conclude the experience in one sentence: "I literally programmed computer".
